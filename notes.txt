Branches:
  Clock-and-queue: make the clock send messages from a score event queue at correct times
  begin-jesting: Add Jest, and write 3 tests for your model.

Clock-and-queue
  - Save scores AND players
    - player comes with clock, so with tempo, time signature, length
  - need a score instance. Just for testing? But where would it really be?
  - Give a clock to a Score or give a score to a Clock?
    - Or give both to something higher
      - Allows multiple scores
      - Cleaner, logical organization


begin-jesting
  - Don't render tests in the browser. Just run in the console. It's Jest.
